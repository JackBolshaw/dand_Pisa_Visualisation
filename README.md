## Date created

This project was created in March 2018.

## Project Title

Data Visualisation using Python using the PISA Dataset.

## Description

In this project I was tasked with creating univariate, bivariate and multivariate visualisations using Python then create a slideshow showcasing my findings.

I have always believed education to be the cornerstone of a functioning society so I have decided to create visualisations using the PISA dataset.

The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a worldwide study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in member and non-member nations
intended to evaluate educational systems by measuring 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading.
This short project is part of my Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree.

## Conclusions

What we've learned during this project, is that whilst being on time is beneficial to each subject individually, when assessing multiple subjects at once with relation to truancy, it seems to make very little difference to the acedemic success of each child. What seems to have a greater impact on a childs scores are the amount of biological parents at home.

We can now also understand that it is beneficial to have siblings at home.

If I were to suggest a plan of action to raise the most acedemically successful children, I would suggest both biological parents to live at home, have multiple children and never be late to school. However these generalisations mean nothing to the individual family and are simply not practical in many situations.

If I were to take this investigation further, I would try and deduce whether it's acedemically more beneficial to have sisters rather than brothers. I'd also like to formulate the exact amount of siblings leads to the highest acedemic success but unfortunately this dataset does not have this information available.

I would personally like to thank my sister for her inspirational help.

Any questions or comments would be gratefully welcomed.
